## CODING STYLE GUIDE - JAVASCRIPT AND TYPESCRIPT (MANDATORY OR STRONGLY ENCOURAGED)

### Naming
- **snake_case** for file names.  
- **camelCase** for instance names.  
- **PascalCase** for class and symbol names.  
- **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants.

### Code Ordering
- **Remote Imports**  
- **Local Imports**  
- **Hoisted Variables and References**  
- **Methods**  
- **Exports**

### Syntax
- Favor modern ECMAScript ES2024 Typescript 5.7 features and patterns:  
  - Object & array **destructuring**  
  - **Optional chaining** (`?.`) & **nullish coalescing** (`??`)  
  - **Arrow functions** & implicit returns  
  - **Template literals** (``) for string interpolation  
  - **Spread** (`...`) & rest parameters  
  - **Proxy** and **Reflect**  
  - **Private class fields**  
  - **Atomics** for concurrency
  - **Logical assignment operators**  
  - **WeakRefs**, **BigInt**, **Crypto**, **SharedArrayBuffer**  
  - **TextEncoder**, **TextDecoder**, **WebSocketStream**, etc.
- **Semicolon Usage**
  - **Always** follow the existing codebase's semicolon style
  - If the codebase uses semicolons, include them consistently
  - If the codebase omits semicolons, ensure they are not added
  - When in doubt, verify the style in multiple files before making assumptions
  - For new codebases, default to **no semicolons** unless specified otherwise

## New Methods That Excite You As Javascript Developer
- Map(), WeakMap(), Set(), WeakSet(), WeakRef()
- Reflect()
- Proxy()
- BigInt()
- SharedArrayBuffer()
- structuredClone()
- TypedArray()
- Symbol()
- FinalizationRegistry()
- New utilitiy methods: str.toCapitalCase(), array.toReversed()
- toWellFormed()
- AllocateArrayBuffer()
- DataVieww()
- Float64Array(), Uint8ClampedArray(), Uint32Array()
- globalThis()
- Promise.withResolvers()
- Promise.try()
- Temporal.Now.zonedDateTimeISO()
- new Realm()

### Examples of Modern
- Atomic waitSync()
```
const sharedArray = new Int32Array(new SharedArrayBuffer(1024));
// Example usage in a hypothetical shared memory scenario
function performSynchronizedOperation(index, value) {
  Atomics.waitSync(sharedArray, index, 0); // Wait until condition is met
  sharedArray[index] = value;
  Atomics.notify(sharedArray, index, 1); // Notify other threads of the update
}
```
- Regular Expressions with the v Flag and Set Notation
```
// Using set notation to match characters with specific Unicode properties
const regex = /\p{Script=Greek}/v;
```
- Pipeline Operator (|>)
```
// Output of one function is passed as input to the next. This makes code easier to read and helps organize complex transformations
const processedValue = -10
  |> (n => Math.max(0, n))
  |> (n => Math.pow(n, 1/3))
  |> Math.ceil;
```
- Records and Tuples (|>)
```
const userProfile = #{ username: "Alice", age: 30 };
const updatedProfile = userProfile.with({ age: 31 });

console.log(updatedProfile); // #{ username: "Alice", age: 31 }
console.log(userProfile);     // #{ username: "Alice", age: 30 } (remains unchanged)
```

### Functional & Compositional Approach
- Within functions, prefer **functional** over imperative control flows.  
- Avoid deeply nested callbacks or chains.  
- When designing classes or relationships, use **composition** over generalization/inheritance.

**Examples:**

**BAD (Imperative):**
```javascript
// Overly imperative
this.on('some action', async (event) => {
  try {
    await handle(event).then(async (ev) => {
      return await endAction(ev)
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(err)
    })
  } catch(err) {
    console.error(err)
  }
})
```

**GOOD (Functional):**
```javascript
// Reduces code length, boosts readability
const errorHandler = console.error
const eventHandler = event => handle(event).then(endAction).catch(errorHandler)
this.on('some action', eventHandler)
```

### Documentation in Code
- Use **JSDoc** for functions and files (including `@module` docs with examples).  
- **DANGER**: When updating code, never remove JSDoc or linting comments unless explicitly requested. If changes break comments, update them accurately.

### Functional vs. OOP
- If entities have large state or define strict interfaces, consider using classes.  
- Otherwise, default to simple, pure functions and straightforward code.

### Pragmatic Proofs of Concept (PoCs)
- For new codebases or prototypes:  
  - Use a **flat file/folder structure**  
  - Write minimal or no tests (maybe one smoke test)  
  - Choose **unopinionated, flexible designs**  
  - Prefer **modern open-source libraries**  
  - If fewer than 5 main JS/TS files exist, keep everything as minimal as possible.

### TypeScript Types
- Avoid or reduce internal usage of types for classes, methods, variables, or interfaces.  
- Expose types only at application boundaries or in public APIs (e.g., library exports).

### Private / Public Interfaces
- Mark private fields or functions clearly.  
- For public interfaces, ensure a clean, well-documented user experience.  
- Patterns may include private fields, singletons, factories, prototypes, observers, or dependency injection.

### Imports
- Understand what is being imported to **leverage the latest ESM features** (e.g., `import type`, import maps, import attributes).
- Imports should be cordered according to the rules about imports in "### Code Ordering".

### Exports
- ***Exports should always be declared at the bottom of code files** and never in the middle.
- Exports delcarations should be as free of logic as possible.
- Prefer simple object exports such as `export {someMethod, anotherMethod}`.

### Error Handling Strategy
- Discourage deeply nested try/catch blocks; prefer flat promise chains and modular error handling.
- Handle asynchronous errors using Promise.allSettled for concurrent operations and catch() chaining for individual error capture.

### Immutable Data Patterns
- Avoid direct mutation of objects and arrays; use immutable operations like map, reduce, and Object.freeze() to maintain state integrity.
- When deep copying, consider using `structuredClone` to avoid unintended mutations.

### Concurrency & Performance Optimizations
- Prefer queueMicrotask() for scheduling microtasks to enhance responsiveness.
- Use Atomics and SharedArrayBuffer for managing shared memory and concurrent operations.
- Utilize Web Workers for parallel processing, offloading heavy computations from the main thread.

### Module Organization
- Follow ESM-only practices; avoid CommonJS imports to maintain modern module consistency.
- Prevent circular dependencies by designing clear module boundaries and keeping responsibilities separate.

### Memory & Performance Considerations
- Optimize large dataset handling by leveraging streaming APIs to process data incrementally.
- Minimize memory footprint using lazy evaluation techniques, processing data only as needed.

### Minimal Testing Strategy
- Recommend integration tests over unit tests for backend logic to ensure system-wide reliability.
- Use built-in test runners from Deno, Bun, or Node based on the runtime environment.
- Favor testable function design with pure functions and minimal side effects to simplify testing.

### Security Best Practices
- Prefer using the built-in crypto.subtle API for cryptographic operations, reducing dependency on third-party libraries.

### Logging & Debugging Strategy
- Employ structured logging (e.g., JSON-based logs) to facilitate clear and consistent log management.
- Enable stack traces for detailed error reporting during development.
- Limit logging in production to critical events to avoid performance degradation.
